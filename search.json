    "text": "1.3 In the blood\n\n\n\nA hospital room (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n\nYou’re in a hospital room now, full of antibiotics and feeling terrible. Your bloods have been taken - so many bloods! - and you’ve been told that the phlebotomists have found an unexpected bacterium. They’re trying to grow it up in agar right now. As you’re a microbiologist you’re naturally curious, and you ask if they’ve identified it yet.\nIt turns out they’ve been having difficulty finding a medium that the bacteria will grow on. They’re trying blood and tryptose broth and, while that’s meeting with some success, it’s very, very slow-growing.\nThey’ve managed to get a preliminary identification from a small sample by MALDI-TOF, (Barth et al. (2023)) which suggests that it’s a Brucella strain of some sort.\nYour heart sinks. You really, really do not want brucellosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy you don’t want brucellosis\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough uncommon the UK, brucellosis is endemic in many developing countries (Laine et al. (2023)). The causative agents, Brucella spp. bacteria, grow less quickly in the open environment than in their hosts, and are highly contagious intracellular pathogens readily spread between individuals and by infectious body fluids (Moreno et al. (2023)).\n\n\n\nFigure 5 from (Laine et al. (2023)) illustrating estimated incidence of human brucellosis, worldwide.\n\n\nIn humans brucellosis is not ofen fatal, but it can be severely disabling. Brucellosis presents in both infectious and non-infectious forms and can be highly persistent, causing chronic debilitation and granulomas within organs. The most common presentations involve greatly enlarged liver and spleen, but other complications - including neurological - may be seen (Franco et al. (2007)). The presentation can be extremely variable, to the extent that “in endemic areas, everything can be due to brucellosis until proven different” (Bosilkovski, Keramat, and Arapović (2021)).\nBlood and bone marrow culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis of brucellosis, but Brucella spp. grow slowly, and it’s not unusual for a culture to take a week or more to reach a size suitable for diagnosis. ELISA is popular but less specific than than many other diagnostic tests. Molecular methods such as PCR and MALDI-TOF have not been as widely validated (Franco et al. (2007)).\nTreatment of brucellosis is unpleasant for the patient, and has hardly changed this century. Treatment requires simultaneous administration of multiple antibiotics for an extended period (e.g. 200mg doxycycline plus 900mg rifampicin, and perhaps a fluoroquinoline in support, for 6-8 weeks). Relapse rates are high (up to 25%) with oral delivery alone but lower with parenteral delivery (up to about 8%) (Franco et al. (2007), Bosilkovski, Keramat, and Arapović (2021)).\nHospital staff potentially exposed to the infectious agent undergo the same treatment as prophylaxis.\n\n\n\nAt the lab they’ve managed to sequence the bacterium that’s in your blood, using an Oxford Nanopore flongle they had lying around. The assembled draft genome has come back, but the NHS is chronically underfunded and the staff are massively overworked, so your consultant hasn’t had time to learn how to classify bacteria from genome sequence data.\n“I’ll have a go, if you like,” you say. Then the light starts to hurt and you have a nap.",

    "section": "1.4 Controversy",
    "text": "1.4 Controversy\n\n\n\nFigure 1 from (Moreno et al. (2022)), showing the relationship between Brucella and Ochrobactrum species. Brucella is a group of bacteria nested within Ochrobactrum.\n\n\nAs an expert biomedical microbiologist, you know that there has recently been a lot of controversy around identification of Brucella, and that preliminary molecular and genomic identifications of Brucella spp. shouldn’t necessarily be taken at face value.\nYou are aware that recent publications in microbial nomenclature renamed a whole genus of much less worrying bacteria, belonging to the Ochrobactrum genus, to Brucella (Hördt et al. (2020)), even though Ochrobactrum spp. are only opportunistic pathogens and not particularly virulent (Hagiya et al. (2013)). Many microbiologists who work in clinical settings, or with Brucella, object to the renaming (Moreno et al. (2022), Moreno et al. (2023)). Even so, some commercial diagnostic equipment has updated its databases and now calls bacteria Brucella that used to be called as Ochrobactrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brucella/Ochrobactrum controversy\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, a manuscript was published applying a bioinformatics methodology to over 1,000 genomes of Alphaproteobacteria type strains. Alphaproteobacteria is the taxonomic Class that contains both Brucella and Ochrobactrum genera (Hördt et al. (2020)).\nIn phylogenetic trees, Brucella and Ochrobactrum are closely-related. Ochrobactrum form a group called a clade (they share a single common ancestor), but Brucella appears as a coherent subgroup with multiple derived characters within this clade.\nThe bioinformatics method applied in Hördt et al. (2020) reproduced this relationship, and a proposal was made that, because Brucella was nested within Ochrobactrum, the entire group of bacteria - including all Ochrobactrum - should be named Brucella. It was argued in this paper that, even though Brucella and Ochrobactrum are not as virulent as each other, they should be considered to belong to different “risk groups,” but also to be fundamentally similar organisms (Hördt et al. (2020)).\nClinical microbiologists and other scientists rejected this proposal, arguing that the names of bacteria do more than indicate where they lie in a phylogenetic tree. They argue that the long-standing use of brucellosis to refer to the serious disease caused only by Brucella ends up being confused - potentially dangerously - if relatively low-risk bacteria such as Ochrobactrum are renamed as Brucella. They also argue that “typology,” taking into consideration more than phylogenetic placement, is necessary for meaningful naming and subdivision of bacteria, and that bioinformatics methods alone are not sufficient to define bacterial taxa. They consider that Brucella and Ochrobactrum strains show quite different phenotypes, and should therefore remain known by different names (Moreno et al. (2022), Moreno et al. (2023)).\n\n\n\nTable 1 from (Moreno et al. (2022))\n\n\nSince the nomenclature change, there have been instances of bacteria formerly known as Ochrobactrum being identified as Brucella by commercial MALDI-TOF instruments in a clinical context, leading to avoidable prophylactic treatment of hospital staff (Moreno et al. (2023)).\nNow that the name Brucella has been validly published in the literature for bacteria formerly known as Ochrobactrum, and is considered the “correct” name for the group, it is highly unlikely it would be withdrawn, under the the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP, the Prokaryotic Code). The controversy continues.\n\n\n\nYou know that if you make a positive identification of this bacterium as something other than Brucella, you might avoid eight weeks of unpleasant multiple antibiotic treatment, and so can staff who were potentially exposed to Brucella through your sample. If this infection does turn out to be Brucella they would also need to undergo prophylactic treatment.\nYour identification could save a lot of people - not least you! - quite a bit of unpleasantness.",

    "text": "2.3 16S sequence\n16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) is an evolutionarily highly-optimised, essential component of bacterial SSU (small subunit) ribosomes. Because it is essential, and its function in protein synthesis is central to correct operation of the cell, its biological sequence is highly constrained (it is unlikely that a change in the sequence will enhance or be neutral to function). This has two main implications that make it useful for evolutionary analysis and microbial identification.\n\nThe 16S sequence is similar enough to be recognisable in all prokaryotes\nThe 16S sequence is usually most similar in organisms that share a recent common ancestor, and less similar in organisms that share a more distant common ancestor.\n\nThese properties enable the 16S rRNA sequence to be used to reconstruct evolutionary histories of prokaryotes, including the landmark paper that defined Archaea as a new domain of life (Woese, Kandler, and Wheelis (1990)). Several online reference databases with curated 16S sequence data are commonly used to enable bioinformatic identification of organisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe properties noted above also make 16S rRNA useful for identifying which bacteria are present in complex communities: microbiome analyses (Johnson et al. (2019))).\nThe similarity of 16S sequences across all bacteria mean that a single set of primers (universal primers) can be used to amplify most 16S bacterial genes in a sample using PCR.\nSequencing the amplified 16S genes with high-throughput sequencing then allows the distinct identities of many bacteria in a sample to be determined simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of 16S sequence data for identification and classification\n\n\n\n\n\n16S sequence data has more recently fallen out of favour for bacterial classification and identification. This is in part due to the increased availability of high-throughput whole-genome sequencing; with this technology the whole genome can be obtained at the same time as the 16S gene sequence, and the extra information allows for more precise identification. But there are also inherent disadvantages of the approach.\n\nWhole-genome sequencing is practical, inexpensive, and provides more information, including the 16S sequence.\n\nAmplifying a variable subregion of 16S provides about 300bp of information, sequencing the full 16S gene about 1500bp, and sequencing a genome between 1,500,000bp and 12,000,000bp (depending on organism)\n\nSome distinct species share identical 16S sequences (R. C. Edgar (2018a))\nSome organisms/species possess multiple distinct 16S sequences (R. C. Edgar (2018a))\nThere is no universal level of similarity (percentage identity) between 16S sequences that always corresponds to a taxonomic division (R. C. Edgar (2018b))\n16S databases contain many sequences that are incomplete, contain errors, or are annotated with the wrong taxonomic identity (R. Edgar (2018))\n\n\n\n\nThe 16S sequence for your isolate has been identified from the genome sequence and is described in the isolate_16S.fasta FASTA file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin your identification\n\n\n\nYou should begin the identification of your isolate by submitting the 16S sequence in isolate_16S.fasta to some of these public resources. click on the link to 16S (here, or below), to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgar, Robert. 2018. “Taxonomy Annotation and Guide Tree Errors in 16S rRNA Databases.” PeerJ 6 (e5030): e5030.\n\n\nEdgar, Robert C. 2018a. “Accuracy of Taxonomy Prediction for 16S rRNA and Fungal ITS Sequences.” PeerJ 6 (e4652): e4652.\n\n\n———. 2018b. “Updating the 97% Identity Threshold for 16S Ribosomal RNA OTUs.” Bioinformatics 34 (14): 2371–75.\n\n\nJohnson, Jethro S, Daniel J Spakowicz, Bo-Young Hong, Lauren M Petersen, Patrick Demkowicz, Lei Chen, Shana R Leopold, et al. 2019. “Evaluation of 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing for Species and Strain-Level Microbiome Analysis.” Nat.

It is typically more precise and has more resolving power than 16S sequence analysis, but less precise than whole-genome sequence analysis (Maiden et al. (2013)).\nMLST works by defining marker sequences for a taxon. These are typically well-conserved (“housekeeping”) genes which very relatively little between organisms in the taxon, but enough to allow discrimination between them. The number of markers varies, but is usually somewhere around seven.\nEach marker sequence has many variants (different sequences) within the taxon, and these are known as alleles. Each marker allele is given a unique number (starting at 1 and counting upwards) - its allele number. A single organism’s sequence type (ST) is determined by the list of allele numbers that it contains. Organisms with the same sequence type are considered to be part of the same group.\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of MLST. In this typing scheme there are seven markers (“housekeeping genes”). One of these is the gene adk, which has a different sequence in each of the strains A, B, and C - so these have different allele numbers (1, 2, and 3). Another marker, pdhC has the same sequence (allele number) in strains A and C, but a different sequence (allele number) in strain B. The strains have allele numbers: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (A); 2,2,2,1,2,1,2 (B); 1,3,2,2,1,3,2 (C). These lists are different, so the strains have different sequence types.",

    "text": "Type Strains\n\n\n\n\n\nA type strain is the representative of a taxon: the nomenclatural “type” on which the definition of a taxon (such as species) is based. Type strains must be deposited in at least two separate public culture collections, in different countries.\nNot all taxa (in particular Candidate phyla) have type strains. It is a requirement for type strains that the organism is grown and cultured, as it cannot otherwise be placed in a culture collection. But it has been estimated that not only are the majority of bacteria and archaea so far uncultured, but they may even be unculturable in the laboratory (Hofer (2018)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow TYGS Classification Works\n\n\n\n\n\nTYGS takes a prokaryotic genome as input, and assigns a taxonomic identity after a series of pairwise genome comparisons.\nFirst, the input genome is compared to the type strain database using an approach called MASH (Ondov et al. (2016)). The ten type strain genomes, and the ten most closely related type strains identified by 16S rDNA gene (extracted automatically from the input) similarity.\nThis set of 20 type strain genomes is then used to find the best 50 matching type strains. A phylogenetic tree is then constructed using the Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny approach (GBDP, Henz et al. (2005)), and the resulting distances used to determine the 10 closest type strain genomes for each of the user genomes. The between-genome distances for this are calculated using digital DNA-DNA hybridisation (dDDH, Meier-Kolthoff et al. (2013)).\nTYGS compiles classification output into a PDF file, and presents the resulting phylogeny on the TYGS website. All results tables and trees can be downloaded in shareable formats.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the TYGS server\n\n\n\nClick on Submit your query (top menu), or Submit your job (button) to reach the query page\n\n\n\nClick on the Browse… button and navigate to your isolate_genome.fasta file to select it for classification.\nEnter your email address in the Provide contact details field\n\n\n\nClick on Submit query and wait for the results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis may take some time (maybe over an hour, depending on server load!), and may not be complete before the end of the workshop.\nPlease move on to the next section while you are waiting.\n\n\n\nWhen you get the result confirmation email, download and inspect the result PDF, and examine the whole-genome tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the predicted taxonomic classification of your isolate’s genome?\nHow similar is your isolate’s genome to the closest match? (the \\(d_4\\) result is the dDDH (digital DNA-DNA hybridisation) score)\nWhat are the most closely-related species and genera in the whole-genome tree?

    "section": "5.2 genomeRxiv",
    "text": "5.2 genomeRxiv\ngenomeRxiv is a recently-developed approach to bacterial classification that promises to identify and classify prokaryotic genomes quickly and accurately into categories called LINgroups (LIN: Life Identification Number). LINgroups are a taxonomy-independent, quantitative categorisation scheme that organises genome sequences by similarity in multidimensional “space”. These categorisations can then be used to relate alternative taxonomic assignments, and other annotations, to each other (Pritchard et al. (2022)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow genomeRxiv works\n\n\n\n\n\ngenomeRxiv works in a similar way to map grid references.\n\n\n\nExample map grid references: point A has grid reference 970 (Easting) and 280 (Northing) as x-y co-ordinates, so the total reference is 970280. Similarly, point B is at 989319, and point C at 005255. All points in the map, however large or small, are uniquely assigned to a discrete location and, by subdividing the map into smaller and smaller squares (longer and longer numbers) an arbitrary level of precision can be reached\n\n\ngenomeRxiv compares input sequences to a reference database with a very fast bioinformatics algorithm (sourmash) to get a set of good matches, and then refines the match with a more precise but slower algorithm (ANI). genomeRxiv then assigns a LINgroup to the genome (Tian et al. (2021)). The LINgroup is a string of numbers, analogous to a map co-ordinate. The shorter the LINgroup, the lower the resolution of identification (Phylum, Family, etc.), and the longer the LINgroup, the finer the resolution (species, subspecies, strain, etc.).\nThe first key difference between LINgroups and map co-ordinates is that LINgroups are not co-ordinates on a two-dimensional surface, but in many-dimensional space. The second is that a single number describes the location, rather than two numbers (the “Easting” and “Northing” of map co-ordinates. Finally, grid references represent a physical space (such as the surface of the Earth), and LINgroups represent “sequence space” - which is not physical (Mazloom et al. (2022)).\n\n\n\nExample arbitrary projection of 380 Ralstonia solanacearum genomes into three dimensions, based on overall genome similarity. Each sphere is a single genome. The genomes can be clustered into groups of genomes that are more similar to each other than they are to other genomes in the dataset. These clusters are assigned different colours. Each genome, such as the one indicated, has a unique co-ordinate in this “sequence space.”\n\n\nTaxa are then defined by the volumes in space circumscribed by genomes which are examples of each taxon. When a new unknown genome is added, a LINgroup is assigned and - if it lies within a volume of space contained only by members of a single taxon (e.g. E. coli), the genome is assigned that taxon.\n\n\n\nThe genomeRxiv webservice allows users to input their bacterial genomes and rapidly obtain, or predict, taxonomic assignments on the basis of genome sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\ngenomeRxiv remains under active development and is not yet fully-released, although it is public and usable.\n\n\n\nGo to the genomeRxiv server\n\n - Click on Identify using a FASTA file\n\n\nEither click on the Sequence to be identified link to bring up a dialogue box through which you can upload the isolate_genome.fasta file, or drag the isolate_genome.fasta file onto the text.\nClick on Identify and wait for the results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe genomeRxiv site may ask you to allow pop-ups. You should allow the pop-ups, as these contain the identification output you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting genomeRxiv results\n\n\n\ngenomeRxiv provides three classifications:\n\nTentative LIN: this is the LIN specific to the submitted genome. It may or may not match an existing, previously-assigned LIN.\nClosest Genome: this is the LIN corresponding to the closest-matching genome in the genomeRxiv database. It is unlikely to match the LIN of the submitted genome exactly, even if it’s a genome from the same species.\nMember LINgroups: this is the LINgroup that circumscribes a known taxon, as close to and enclosing the submitted genome, as possible. This is the likely identity of your isolate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the predicted taxonomic classification of your isolate’s genome? (Check the Member LINgroups result)\nWhat is the taxonomic identity assigned to the most similar genome in the database?\nHow similar is your isolate’s genome to the closest match? (Look at the ANI to Target value)\nWhat is your current opinion about the identity of your isolate? Have you modified your classification? How confident are you in the identification?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider your final evaluation\n\n\n\nYou have now used a number of different online bioinformatics tools to obtain a possible taxonomic classification for the isolate in your blood sample. You should, by this point, have some idea of what you think the organism is, and how confident you are.
