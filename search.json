    "text": "1.3 In the blood\n\n\n\nA hospital room (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n\nYou’re in a hospital room now, feeling terrible. Your bloods have been taken - so many bloods! - and you’ve been told that the phlebotomists have found an unexpected bacterium. They’re trying to grow it up right now. As you’re a microbiologist you’re naturally curious, and you ask if they’ve identified it yet.\nIt turns out they’ve been having difficulty finding a medium that the bacteria will grow on. They’re trying blood and tryptose broth and, while that’s meeting with some success, it’s very, very slow-growing.\nThey’ve managed to get a preliminary identification from a small sample by MALDI-TOF, which suggests that it’s a Brucella strain of some sort.\nYour heart sinks. You really, really do not want brucellosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy you don’t want brucellosis\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough uncommon the UK, brucellosis is endemic in many developing countries (Laine et al. (2023)). The causative agents, Brucella spp. bacteria, grow less quickly in the open environment than in their hosts, and are highly contagious intracellular pathogens readily spread between individuals and by infectious body fluids (Moreno et al. (2023)).\n\n\n\nFigure 5 from (Laine et al. (2023)) illustrating estimated incidence of human brucellosis, worldwide.\n\n\nIn humans brucellosis is not ofen fatal, but it can be severely disabling. Brucellosis presents in both infectious and non-infectious forms and can be highly persistent, causing chronic debilitation and granulomas within organs. The most common presentations involve greatly enlarged liver and spleen, but other complications - including neurological - may be seen (Franco et al. (2007)). The presentation can be extremely variable, to the extent that “in endemic areas, everythign can be due to brucellosis until proven different” (Bosilkovski, Keramat, and Arapović (2021)).\nBlood and bone marrow culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis of brucellosis, but Brucella spp. grow slowly, and it’s not unusual for a culture to take a week or more to reach a size suitable for diagnosis. ELISA is popular but less specific than than many other diagnostic tests. Molecular methods such as PCR and MALDI-TOF have not been as widely validated (Franco et al. (2007)).\nTreatment of brucellosis is unpleasant for the patient, and has hardly changed this century. Treatment requires simultaneous administration of multiple antibiotics for an extended period (e.g. 200mg doxycycline plus 900mg rifampicin, and perhaps a fluoroquinoline in support, for 6-8 weeks). Relapse rates are high (up to 25%) with oral delivery alone but lower with parenteral delivery (up to about 8%) (Franco et al. (2007), Bosilkovski, Keramat, and Arapović (2021)).\nHospital staff potentially exposed to the infectious agent need to undergo the same treatment as prophylaxis.\n\n\n\nAt the lab they’ve managed to sequence the bacterium that’s in your blood, using an Oxford Nanopore flongle they had lying around. The assembled genome has come back, but the NHS is chronically underfunded and the staff are massively overworked, so your consultant hasn’t had time to learn how to classify bacteria from genome sequence data.\n“I’ll have a go if you like,” you say."

    "section": "1.4 Controversy",
    "text": "1.4 Controversy\n\n\n\nFigure 1 from (Moreno et al. (2022)), showing the relationship between Brucella and Ochrobactrum species. Brucella is a group of bacteria nested within Ochrobactrum.\n\n\nAs an expert biomedical microbiologist, you know that there has recently been a lot of controversy around identification Brucella, and that preliminary identifications of Brucella spp. shouldn’t be taken at face value.\nYou are aware that recent changes in microbial nomenclature renamed a whole genus of much less worrying bacteria belonging to the Ochrobactrum genus to Brucella (Hördt et al. (2020)), even though they’re an opportunistic pathogen and not particularly virulent (Hagiya et al. (2013)). Many microbiologists who work in clinical settings, or with Brucella, object to the renaming (Moreno et al. (2022), Moreno et al. (2023)). Even so, some commercial diagnostic equipment has updated its databases and now calls as Brucella what used to be Ochrobactrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brucella/Ochrobactrum controversy\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, a manuscript was published applying a bioinformatics methodology to over 1,000 genomes of Alphaproteobacteria type strains. Alphaproteobacteria is the taxonomic Class that contains both Brucella and Ochrobactrum genera (Hördt et al. (2020)).\nIn phylogenetic trees, Brucella and Ochrobactrum are closely-related. Ochrobactrum form a group called a clade (they share a single common ancestor), but Brucella appears as a coherent, derived group within this clade.\nThe bioinformatics method applied in Hördt et al. (2020) reproduced this relationship, and a proposal was made that, because Brucella was nested within Ochrobactrum, the entire group of bacteria - including all Ochrobactrum - should be named Brucella. It was argued in this paper that, even though Brucella and Ochrobactrum are not as virulent as each other, they should be considered to belong to different “risk groups,” but to be fundamentally similar organisms (Hördt et al. (2020)).\nClinical microbiologists and other scientists rejected this proposal, arguing that the names of bacteria do more than indicate where they lie in a phylogenetic tree. They argue that the customary use of brucellosis to refer to the serious disease caused by Brucella ends up being confused - potentially dangerously - if relatively low-risk bacteria such as Ochrobactrum are renamed as Brucella. They also argue that “typology,” taking into consideration more than phylogenetic placement, is necessary for meaningful naming and subdivision of bacteria, and that bioinformatics methods alone are not enough to define bacterial taxa. They consider that Brucella and Ochrobactrum strains show quite different phenotypes, and should remain under different names (Moreno et al. (2022), Moreno et al. (2023)).\n\n\n\nTable 1 from (Moreno et al. (2022))\n\n\nSince the nomenclature change, there have been instances of bacteria formerly known as Ochrobactrum being identified as Brucella by MALDI-TOF instruments in a clinical context, leading to avoidable prophylactic treatment of hospital staff to avoid infection with Brucella (Moreno et al. (2023)).\nNow that the name Brucella has been validly published in the literature for bacteria formerly known as Ochrobactrum, and is considered the “correct” name for the group, it is highly unlikely it would be withdrawn, under the the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP, the Prokaryotic Code). The controversy continues.\n\n\n\nYou know that if you make a positive identification of this bacterium as something other than Brucella, you might avoid eight weeks of unpleasant multiple antibiotic treatment, and so can staff who were potentially exposed to Brucella through your sample. If this infection does turn out to be Brucella they would also need to undergo prophylactic treatment.\nYour identification could save a lot of people quite a bit of unpleasantness."

    "text": "2.3 16S sequence\n16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) is a highly-optimised, essential component of bacterial SSU (small subunit) ribosomes. Because it is essential, and its function in protein synthesis is central to correct operation of a cell, its biological sequence is highly constrained (it is unlikely that a change in the sequence will enhance or be neutral to function). This has two main implications that make it useful for evolutionary analysis and microbial identification.\n\nThe 16S sequence is similar enough to be recognisable across all prokaryotes\nThe 16S sequence is usually most similar in organisms that share a recent common ancestor, and less similar in organisms that share a more distant common ancestor.\n\nThese properties enable the 16S rRNA sequence to be used to reconstruct evolutionary histories of prokaryotes, including the landmark paper that defined Archaea as a new domain of life (Woese, Kandler, and Wheelis (1990)). Several online reference databases with curated 16S sequence data are commonly used to enable bioinformatic identification of organisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese properties also make 16S rRNA useful for identifying which bacteria are present in complex communities (microbiome analyses).\nThe similarity of 16S sequences across all bacteria mean that a single set of primers (universal primers) can be used to amplify most 16S bacterial genes in a sample using PCR.\nSequencing the amplified 16S genes with high-throughput sequencing then allows the distinct identities of many bacteria in a sample to be determined simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of 16S sequence data for identification and classification\n\n\n\n\n\n16S sequence data has more recently fallen out of favour for bacterial classification and identification. This is in part due to the increased availability of high-throughput whole-genome sequencing; with this technology the whole genome can be obtained at the same time as the 16S gene sequence, and the extra information allows for more precise identification. But there are also inherent disadvantages of the approach.\n\nWhole-genome sequencing is practical, inexpensive, and provides more information, including the 16S sequence.\n\nAmplifying a variable subregion of 16S provides about 300bp of information, sequencing the full 16S gene about 1500bp, and sequencing a genome between 1,500,000bp and 12,000,000bp (depending on organism)\n\nSome distinct species share identical 16S sequences\nSome organisms/species possess multiple distinct 16S sequences\nThere is no universal level of similarity (percentage identity) between 16S sequences that always corresponds to a taxonomic division\n16S databases contain many sequences that are incomplete, contain errors, or are annotated with the wrong taxonomic identity\n\n\n\n\nThe 16S sequence for your isolate has been identified from the genome sequence and is described in the isolate_16S.fasta FASTA file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin your identification\n\n\n\nYou should begin the identification of your isolate by submitting the 16S sequence in isolate_16S.fasta to some of these public resources. click on the link to 16S (here, or below), to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoese, C R, O Kandler, and M L Wheelis. 1990. “Towards a Natural System of Organisms: Proposal for the Domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya.” Proc.

The key points in that text are:\n\nAny taxon may have only one correct name. This is usually the earliest validly published, legitimate name.\nThe LPSN selects certain taxon names as correct names. If more than one option is available, then the LPSN’s choice reflects only one of the taxonomic opinions expressed in the literature.\nValid names representing other taxonomic opinions are given synonym status.\nOther scientists may express distinct taxonomic opinions and are permitted to do so, by using a synonym.\n\nThe term correct is therefore used in a technical sense, in a taxonomic context. The existence of a correct name for a taxon does not imply that other names (synonyms) are invalid or cannot be used.\n\n\n\n\nRead the Notes section on the LPSN page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nHow do the notes on this page reflect the controversy over naming of Ochrobactrum/Brucella described in the Introduction?\nDoes the LPSN page affect your opinion about how you have classified your isolate?\nFinally, what is the taxonomic name you would use for your isolate?"
