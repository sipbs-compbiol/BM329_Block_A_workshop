# LPSN: the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature

## Investigating your classification at LPSN

- Go to the [LPSN](https://www.bacterio.net/) server
- Enter the taxonomic classification you think should be assigned to your organism in the `Search taxonomy` field, and hit `Return`/`Enter`. The result should appear immediately.

::: { .callout-important title="Questions"}
1. What kind of taxonomic category does the name of your organism represent?
2. What does the name mean, and what does it imply about the bacteria?
3. Is the name you entered a validly published taxonomic name?
4. What is the parent taxon for this name?
:::

- Click on the link by `Parent taxon:` (the value here is also the answer to question 4. above).

5. Is this name the "correct name" for the organism?

## What does "correct name" mean in a taxonomic context?

The precise meaning of "correct name" in this context is provided in a [glossary at LPSN](https://lpsn.dsmz.de/text/glossary). The key points in that text are:

- Any taxon may have only one _correct_ name. This is usually the earliest validly published, legitimate name.
- The LPSN selects certain taxon names as _correct_ names. If more than one option is available, then the LPSN's choice reflects only _one_ of the taxonomic opinions expressed in the literature.
- Valid names representing other taxonomic opinions are given _synonym_ status.
- Other scientists may express distinct taxonomic opinions and are permitted to do so, by using a _synonym_.

**The term _correct_ is therefore used in a technical sense, in a taxonomic context. The existence of a _correct_ name for a taxon does not imply that other names (_synonyms_) are invalid or cannot be used.**

- Read the `Notes` section on the LPSN page. 

::: { .callout-important title="Questions"}
1. How do the notes on this page reflect the controversy over naming of _Ochrobactrum_/_Brucella_ described in the [Introduction](intro.qmd)?
2. Does the LPSN page affect your opinion about how you have classified your isolate?
3. Finally, what is the taxonomic name you would use for your isolate?
