               using neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood

               overall branching order, and also the order of the subclades,
               were not stable in either assay, which could be explained by
               generally high recA and rrs sequence similarities. Ochrobactrum

               other known species or grouped as potential novel Ochrobactrum
               species. In further investigations, these strains were
               reclassified and described as novel species. In summary,
               Ochrobactrum is a highly diverse genus comprising several novel
               species. We recommend recA- in addition to rrs gene-analysis for

               Historically, an evidence-based estimate of the global annual
               incidence of human cases has been elusive. We used international
               public health data to fill this information gap through
               application of risk metrics to worldwide and regional at-risk
               populations. We performed estimations using 3 statistical models
               (weighted average interpolation, bootstrap resampling, and
               Bayesian inference) and considered missing information. An
               evidence-based conservative estimate of the annual global
               incidence is 2.1 million, significantly higher than was
               previously assumed. Our models indicate Africa and Asia sustain
               most of the global risk and cases, although areas within the
               Americas and Europe remain of concern. This study reveals that
               disease risk and incidence are higher than previously suggested
               and lie mainly within resource-limited settings. Clarification
               of both misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis is required because

               varying morphologies, physiologies and habitat preferences many
               of which are of clinical and ecological importance.
               Alphaproteobacteria classification has proved to be difficult,
               not least when taxonomic decisions rested heavily on a limited
               number of phenotypic features and interpretation of poorly
               resolved 16S rRNA gene trees. Despite progress in recent years
               regarding the classification of bacteria assigned to the class,
               there remains a need to further clarify taxonomic relationships.
               Here, draft genome sequences of a collection of genomes of more
               than 1000 Alphaproteobacteria and outgroup type strains were
               used to infer phylogenetic trees from genome-scale data using
               the principles drawn from phylogenetic systematics. The majority
               of taxa were found to be monophyletic but several orders,
               families and genera, including taxa recognized as problematic
               long ago but also quite recent taxa, as well as a few species
               were shown to be in need of revision. According proposals are
               made for the recognition of new orders, families and genera, as
               well as the transfer of a variety of species to other genera and
               of a variety of genera to other families. In addition, emended
               descriptions are given for many species mainly involving
               information on DNA G+C content and (approximate) genome size,
               both of which are confirmed as valuable taxonomic markers.
               Similarly, analysis of the gene content was shown to provide
               valuable taxonomic insights in the class. Significant
               incongruities between 16S rRNA gene and whole genome trees were
               not found in the class. The incongruities that became obvious
               when comparing the results of the present study with existing
               classifications appeared to be caused mainly by insufficiently
               resolved 16S rRNA gene trees or incomplete taxon sampling.
               Another probable cause of misclassifications in the past is the
               partially low overall fit of phenotypic characters to the
               sequence-based tree. Even though a significant degree of
               phylogenetic conservation was detected in all characters
               investigated, the overall fit to the tree varied considerably.",

              with the primarily free-living, phylogenetically related
              Ochrobactrum spp. in the genus Brucella. This change, founded

              free-living bacteria with a few species occasionally infecting
              medically compromised patients. A group of taxonomists recently
              included all Ochrobactrum organisms in the genus Brucella based
              on global genome analyses and alleged equivalences with genera
              such as Mycobacterium. Here, we demonstrate that such
              equivalencies are incorrect because they overlook the
              complexities of pathogenicity. By summarizing Brucella and
              Ochrobactrum divergences in lifestyle, structure, physiology,
              population, closed versus open pangenomes, genomic traits, and
              pathogenicity, we show that when they are adequately understood,
              they are highly relevant in taxonomy and not unidimensional
              quantitative characters. Thus, the Ochrobactrum and Brucella
              differences are not limited to their assignments to different
              ``risk-groups'', a biologically (and hence, taxonomically)
              oversimplified description that, moreover, does not support

              with highly pathogenic Brucella organisms brings evident risks
              for veterinarians, medical doctors, and public health authorities
              who confront brucellosis, a significant zoonosis worldwide.
              Therefore, from taxonomical and practical standpoints, the
              Brucella and Ochrobactrum genera must be maintained apart.

               be the most important strategy in its management, as eradication
               of animal brucellosis is not possible so far, and there is no
               adequate vaccine for humans. The goal of antibrucellar treatment
               is to alleviate and shorten the symptomatic period and reduce
               complications, relapses, and chronicity. Contemporary trends in
               the treatment of human brucellosis are postulated on the ability
               of Brucellae to persist in host macrophages through the
               inhibition of phagolysosome fusion and to survive for prolonged
               periods intracellularly without restricting basic cellular
               functions. As a result of this and despite satisfactory
               antibiotic treatment, relapses and therapeutical failures are
               inevitable to a certain degree. The current principles for the
               treatment of brucellosis advocate for a long enough treatment

  abstract  = "Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing
               of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes
               (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis
               for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the
               organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular
               comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three
               primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the
               archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very
               dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more
               profound nature than the differences that separate typical
               kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of
               the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships
               among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the
               eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite
               division of the living world. To remedy this situation we
               propose that a formal system of organisms be established in
               which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called
               a ``domain.'' Life on this planet would then be seen as
               comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the
               Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for
               example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of
               others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within
               the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is
               formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota
               (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse
               relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight
               clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose
               general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral
               phenotype of the Archaea.",

               have been developed to support this approach including
               Greengenes, RDP and SILVA. Most taxonomy annotations in these

               ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a fundamental task in microbiology. Most
               experimentally observed sequences are diverged from reference
               sequences of authoritatively named organisms, creating a
               challenge for prediction methods. I assessed the accuracy of
               several algorithms using cross-validation by identity, a new
               benchmark strategy which explicitly models the variation in
               distances between query sequences and the closest entry in a

               averaged over a representative range of identities with the
               reference database (100\%, 99\%, 97\%, 95\% and 90\%), all

               With the V4 region, 95\% identity was found to be a twilight

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Computing genomic similarity between strains is a
               prerequisite for genome-based prokaryotic classification and
               identification. Genomic similarity was first computed as Average
               Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values based on the alignment of
               genomic fragments. Since this is computationally expensive,
               faster and computationally cheaper alignment-free methods have
               been developed to estimate ANI. However, these methods do not
               reach the level of accuracy of alignment-based methods. METHODS:
               Here we introduce LINflow, a computational pipeline that infers
               pairwise genomic similarity in a set of genomes. LINflow takes
               advantage of the speed of the alignment-free sourmash tool to
               identify the genome in a dataset that is most similar to a query
               genome and the precision of the alignment-based pyani software
               to precisely compute ANI between the query genome and the most
               similar genome identified by sourmash. This is repeated for each
               new genome that is added to a dataset. The sequentially computed
               ANI values are stored as Life Identification Numbers (LINs),
               which are then used to infer all other pairwise ANI values in
               the set. We tested LINflow on four sets, 484 genomes in total,
               and compared the needed time and the generated similarity
               matrices with other tools. RESULTS: LINflow is up to 150 times
               faster than pyani and pairwise ANI values generated by LINflow
               are highly correlated with those computed by pyani. However,
               because LINflow infers most pairwise ANI values instead of
               computing them directly, ANI values occasionally depart from the
               ANI values computed by pyani. In conclusion, LINflow is a fast
               and memory-efficient pipeline to infer similarity among a large
               set of prokaryotic genomes. Its ability to quickly add new
               genome sequences to an already computed similarity matrix makes
               LINflow particularly useful for projects when new genome
               sequences need to be regularly added to an existing dataset.",

  abstract  = "Current understanding of the phylogeny of prokaryotes is based
               on the comparison of the highly conserved small ssu-rRNA subunit
               and similar regions. Although such molecules have proved to be
               very useful phylogenetic markers, mutational saturation is a
               problem, due to their restricted lengths. Now, a growing number
               of complete prokaryotic genomes are available. This paper
               addresses the problem of determining a prokaryotic phylogeny
               utilizing the comparison of complete genomes. We introduce a new
               strategy, GBDP, 'genome blast distance phylogeny', and show that
               different variants of this approach robustly produce phylogenies
               that are biologically sound, when applied to 91 prokaryotic
               genomes. In this approach, first Blast is used to compare
               genomes, then a distance matrix is computed, and finally a tree-
               or network-reconstruction method such as UPGMA,
               Neighbor-Joining, BioNJ or Neighbor-Net is applied.",

               intervals and improved distance functions",
  author    = "Meier-Kolthoff, Jan P and Auch, Alexander F and Klenk,
               Hans-Peter and G{\"o}ker, Markus",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: For the last 25 years species delimitation in
               prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria) was to a large extent based
               on DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), a tedious lab procedure designed
               in the early 1970s that served its purpose astonishingly well in
               the absence of deciphered genome sequences. With the rapid
               progress in genome sequencing time has come to directly use the
               now available and easy to generate genome sequences for
               delimitation of species. GBDP (Genome Blast Distance Phylogeny)
               infers genome-to-genome distances between pairs of entirely or
               partially sequenced genomes, a digital, highly reliable
               estimator for the relatedness of genomes. Its application as an
               in-silico replacement for DDH was recently introduced. The main
               challenge in the implementation of such an application is to
               produce digital DDH values that must mimic the wet-lab DDH
               values as close as possible to ensure consistency in the
               Prokaryotic species concept. RESULTS: Correlation and regression
               analyses were used to determine the best-performing methods and
               the most influential parameters. GBDP was further enriched with
               a set of new features such as confidence intervals for
               intergenomic distances obtained via resampling or via the
               statistical models for DDH prediction and an additional family
               of distance functions. As in previous analyses, GBDP obtained
               the highest agreement with wet-lab DDH among all tested methods,
               but improved models led to a further increase in the accuracy of
               DDH prediction. Confidence intervals yielded stable results when
               inferred from the statistical models, whereas those obtained via
               resampling showed marked differences between the underlying
               distance functions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high accuracy of
               GBDP-based DDH prediction, inferences from limited empirical
               data are always associated with a certain degree of uncertainty.
               It is thus crucial to enrich in-silico DDH replacements with
               confidence-interval estimation, enabling the user to
               statistically evaluate the outcomes. Such methodological
               advancements, easily accessible through the web service at
               http://ggdc.dsmz.de, are crucial steps towards a consistent and
               truly genome sequence-based classification of microorganisms.",
